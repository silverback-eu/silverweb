      <br />
      <br />
      3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is
      necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e.
      <br />
      legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to
      comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or
      <br />
      fulfil
      <br />
      our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to
      <br />
      fulfil
      <br />
      our legitimate business interests.
      <br />
      <br />
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to
      explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
      information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process
      your personal information:
      <br />
      Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission
      (i.e.
      <br />
      consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can
      withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your
      consent.
      <br />
      Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is
      necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate
      with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our
      legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in
      which we are involved.
      <br />
      <br />
      Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is
      necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a
      third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety
      of any person.
      <br />
      In legal terms, we are generally the
      <br />
      'data controller'
      <br />
      under European data protection laws of the personal information described
      in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of
      the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the
      personal information we process as a<br />
      'data processor'
      <br />
      on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we
      provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing
      agreement is the
      <br />
      'data controller'
      <br />
      responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your
      information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you
      want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read
      their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.
      <br />
      <br />
      4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in
      this section and/or with the following
      <br />
      third parties. <br />
      <br />
      We
      <br />
      may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
      <br />
      Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in
      connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company
      assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
      another company.
      <br />
      Affiliates. We may share your information with our affiliates, in which
      case we will require those affiliates to
      <br />
      honour
      <br />
      this privacy notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any
      subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control
      or that are under common control with us.
      <br />
      Business Partners. We may share your information with our business
      partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions.
      <br />
      <br />
      5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
      <br />
      fulfil
      <br />
      the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by
      law.
      <br />
      <br />
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
      legal requirements).
      <br />
      No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
      information for longer than
      <br />
      90 days
      <br />.<br />
      <br />
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or
      <br />
      anonymise
      <br />
      such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
      personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
      securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until deletion is possible.
      <br />
      <br />
      6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
      <br />
      organisational
      <br />
      and technical security measures.
      <br />
      <br />
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
      <br />
      organisational
      <br />
      security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
      information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
      secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
      information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
      cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
      <br />
      unauthorised
      <br />
      third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly
      collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
      our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
      information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
      access the Services within a secure environment.
      <br />
      <br />
      7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
      <br />
      children under 18 years of age
      <br />.<br />
      <br />
      We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years
      of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or
      that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
      minor dependentâ€™s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
      information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
      will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
      delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may
      have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
      <br />
      work@silverback.ie
      <br />.<br />
      <br />
      8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short: <br />
      In some regions, such as
      <br />
      the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland
      <br />, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over
      your personal information.
      <br /> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
      <br />
      <br />
      In some regions (like
      <br />
      the EEA, UK, and Switzerland
      <br />
      ), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These
      may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your
      personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to
      restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable,
      to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated
      decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to
      object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a
      request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the
      section
      <br />'<br />
      HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?
      <br />'<br />
      below.
      <br />
      <br />
      We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
      data protection laws.
      <br /> <br />
      If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
      processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain
      to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection
      authority.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data
      Protection and Information Commissioner.
      <br />
      <br />
      Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process
      your personal information,
      <br />
      you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw
      your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
      provided in the section
      <br />'<br />
      HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?
      <br />'<br />
      below
      <br />.<br />
      <br />
      However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
      processing before its withdrawal nor,
      <br />
      will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
      reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
      <br /> <br />
      <br />
      If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email
      us at

      <br />
      9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
      <br />
      <br />
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track (<br />
      'DNT'
      <br />) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
      preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
      monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
      <br />
      recognising
      <br />
      and implementing DNT signals has been
      <br />
      finalised
      <br />. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
      other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
      tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
      follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
      version of this privacy notice.
      <br />
      <br />
      10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?
      <br />
      <br />
      In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant
      with relevant laws.
      <br />
      <br />
      We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version
      will be indicated by an updated
      <br />
      'Revised'
      <br />
      date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is
      accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may
      notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
      directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
      privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your
      information.
