In SilverBack we often talk about lived values demonstrated by leaders and employees alike. In particular, we want to be empathetic – understanding one another and mindful of staff’s [needs and vulnerabilities away from home](https://silverback.ie/supporting-mental-health-for-employees-working-away-from-home-a-silverback-guide/). So, we are thrilled to be sponsoring the [Hillerød Wolfe Tones](https://gaelicgameseurope.com/clubs/hillerod-wolfetones/) and congratulate them on their recent win in the 2023 Intermediate Gaelic Football Championships, their second trophy won over the last 12 months!

Working away from home can be tough so it is great to see community spirit build overseas and introduce different cultures to each other in a sporting way. Indeed, the Hillerød Wolfe Tones have been busy sporting ambassadors with visits to Malmö, Gavle and Den Haag over the past year. No doubt, there have been great memories and experiences gained on these trips and it’s nice to take a few photos to mark the occasion. Even better, if there’s nice SilverBack merchandise to wear too! Well done team.
