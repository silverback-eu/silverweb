SilverBack has not just [been monitoring and writing](https://silverback.ie/spain-takes-the-lead-on-cleantech-investment/) about the progress of the Spanish decarbonisation revolution. Our own Spanish footprint is also growing with up to 15 project roles being filled by citizens of the Iberian nation in the last 12 months. We have been incredibly lucky to avail of the skills of three Spain-focused individuals at head office.

Adrienn Tomolya, equipped with a Masterâ€™s degree in Human Resources & based in Barcelona, specializes in finding potential candidates as a dedicated **Recruitment Consultant**, and Tatiana Villamel, Spanish native, holds the role of **HR Executive**. They both contribute their significant HR expertise, language skills, and operational proficiency to ensure a seamless on and off-boarding process for our clients and candidates.

Meanwhile, Malaga native and Employment Law & Human Resources graduate, Estrella Edalat, moved to Dublin in 2021. Working as a **Travel Coordinator**, Estrella is highly valued for her meticulous logistics organisational skills offering the best solutions for clients and candidates. She is fluent in English and Spanish and is always happy to assist our Barcelona-based colleagues and Spanish-speaking candidates.

As a team, Estrella, Adrienn and Tatiana are a dynamic and dedicated group who are known for their focus on staff welfare, respectful approach and ambition to innovate and drive improved processes at SilverBack for clients and candidates. Furthermore, we believe this team will continue to be a big part of our growing Spanish operational footprint.
